            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 opacity-90">
                In today's fast-paced digital world, we consume vast amounts of information. Designers snap UI examples, developers save code snippets, and creatives collect endless visual references. But without proper organization and context, these valuable assets often get "forgor" (forgotten), buried in unsearchable folders or fleeting browser tabs. The mental overhead of organizing can be overwhelming, leading to missed opportunities and creative blocks.
            </p>
            
            <h2 class="text-neonGreen-DEFAULT text-3xl font-display mb-4 mt-8">Our Solution</h2>
